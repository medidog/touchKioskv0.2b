touchKioskv0.2b
==============

Modern HTML5 Touch Kiosk App for Museums*

*Automatically resizes the background with the pins according to ratio of the kiosk machine. Works better on 16:9 (1920x1080)

Based on Video.js, BigVideo.js and Modernizr.js and jQuery.easing (opensource), merged with iMapper.js (licenced-not included), Chrome Kiosk Mode is also used to make the kiosk machine lock on fullscreen. (ALT+F4 to quit.)

All source code is open sourced except iMapper, which was licenced for one time in this project.
